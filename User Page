##About Me!

My name is Anusha Rao and I am a junior studying **Computer Engineering** at the University of California, San Diego. I am interested in studying Machine Learning and its applications in interdisciplinary fields.
Outside of being a student, I am involved in several campus organizations. I serve as the President of *Triton Racing*, the Formula SAE team at UCSD. This year, we are building our first Electric Vehicle this year, which is a very exciting and time-consuming endeavour.
I also work in the Digital Health Technologies lab, where I work with a team to create a mailable pupilometry device. I really like learning about how computer science and engineering can apply to medicine and the medical device field!

> Fun Fact: I play piano and do Indian Classical Dance!

Outside of school, I love to watch movies and read books! I also love concerts and music!

2. Miss Congenialty
3. 10 Things I Hate About You

> Catch a theme above? I would say that Romantic-Comedies are my favorite genre.


##Who I am as a Programmer

Languages I know:
- C++
- C
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- SQL

I really enjoy working in groups to acheive code-based solutions to everyday problems. I would say my favorite programming language is Python, mainly because I think its syntax makes understanding, designing and synthesizing much clearer amongst groups of programmers.
